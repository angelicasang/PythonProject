    "# Statistical Inference\n",
    "## Lesson overview:\n",
    "In this lesson we will go over statistical inference. We will start with one-sample tests (both for means and proportions), as well as calculating confidence intervals. Then, we will move to two-sample and paired tests. Lastly, we will also guide you to perform one-way ANOVA test, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression by using statsmodels.formula.api.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session you will be able to:\n",
    "* Use statsmodels.stats.proportion, scipy.stats, statsmodels.api and statsmodels.formula.api to perform statistical inference: one-sample tests, two-sample tests, paired data tests, one-way anova, SLR and MLR.\n",
    "* Practice creating plots for checking conditions."
