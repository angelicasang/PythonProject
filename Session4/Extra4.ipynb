    "# Extra Material for Lesson 4\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the fourth lesson in our series about Python for Introductory Statistics. We hope that you were able to learn a lot through our materials, and within this Jupyter notebook you will find even more information about how Python can help you perform statistical inference. Kudos to you for going the extra mile to take on new challenges in this coding language. As always, please refer back to the techniques for getting help that we introduced you to in Lessone One if you get stuck. Happy learning!"

This method does not provide you with the ANOVA table, rather it extracts just these two important values. We will return the backpack data to show you this example.
